# Simple Drum Sequencer - [SDS-101]

While trying to get my hands on Xamarin Forms & MVVM I build this small demo app. The audio is problematic due to the performance issue and latency of the standard OS audio API's. I use a 3rd party wrapper https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugin.SimpleAudioPlayer/ to play audio samples.  

Anyway at least the interface looks quite slick :-)... Maybe in the future I will rebuild the app in SuperCollider with some actual realtime synthesis.

For now I got it running for UWP on Windows 10.
